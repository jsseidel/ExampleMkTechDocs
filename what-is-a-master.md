# What is a master file?

MkTechDocs uses the concept of a "master document," which is nothing more than a normal markdown file that includes other markdown files. Here is this project's `master.md` file, for example:

```{.include-code language=markdown}
master.md
```

We'll get to `include` blocks next, but for now, just note that `master.md` serves as a mapping of which documents to include in your project and in which order.
